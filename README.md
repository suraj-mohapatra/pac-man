Game Mods  
initial life is set to 7 and it never decreases  


How did I do this?  

No big deal. Launched https://www.google.com/logos/2010/pacman10-i.html  

copied all the resources, placed them in the right directory structure.  

modified few lines with hit and trial.

What else can we mod ?

- The sprite sheet can be edited for different graphics
- nore points
- speed control
- ghost mode for the protagonist
